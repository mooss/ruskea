particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problemshe nightmare of a clash between those in trouble

caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six oviet correspondents accreditedhe impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite r usks personal popularity that the nited tates delegation came to slo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spotshe ecretary of tate himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the nited tates that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four monthsut where the core of  is concerned the ecretary of tate has not only reiterated the nited tates profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at s disposal in uropean watershe ecretary of tate has also solemnly repeated a warning to the oviet nion that the nited tates will not stand for another setback in erlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a wholeonflict surveyedhe secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of  realization that astest friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must
